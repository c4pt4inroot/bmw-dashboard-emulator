Description:
    This module provides a function to send the engine RPM value
    via CAN bus to the vehicle dashboard.

    The RPM value is expected between 0 and 8000 and is scaled 
    to fit into a single byte in the CAN frame.

Usage:
    from modules.rpm import send_rpm
    send_rpm(can, rpm_value=3000)
